 * An increasingly popular approach to tailor APIs to individual use cases is to use graph-based
  APIs. A graph-based API exposes a schema composed of types,
  fields, and relationships across types. The API allows a client to
  declare what data it needs and make a request.

CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation.  At its heart is the notion that you can use a different model to update information than the model you use to read information. Many systems do fit a CRUD mental model, and so should be done in that style. There is an inherent
replication lag between the time a change has been applied on the write path and the read path has received and applied it, which
makes the system sequentially consistent. Ref: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html

Sharding Strategies of key-value store
* The mapping between keys and partitions, and other metadata, is
typically maintained in a strongly-consistent configuration store,
like etcd or Zookeeper.
* Ideally, if a partition is added, only ùêæ/ùëÅ keys should be shuffled
around, where ùêæ is the number of keys and ùëÅ the number of
partitions. A hashing strategy that guarantees this property is
called stable hashing. Ring hashing is an example of stable hashing. With ring hashing,
a function maps a key to a point on a circle. The circle is then split
into partitions that can be evenly or pseudo-randomly spaced, depending on the specific algorithm. When a new partition is added,
it can be shown that most keys don‚Äôt need to be shuffled around. E.g Consistent Hashing.
